/**
 * Interface that represents the result of a {@link com.konfigyr.artifactory.PropertyMetadata} provenance evaluation
 * for a specific {@link VersionedArtifact artifact version}.
 * <p>
 * This interface is intentionally sealed to ensure that we cover all possible outcomes and to provide a type-safe
 * way to manage state transitions of {@link com.konfigyr.artifactory.PropertyMetadata} in the Artifactory domain.
 * <p>
 * This is a list of the following evaluation outcomes:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         <strong>New property</strong>: the property that is being evaluated is not yet known and should be
 *         inserted in the Artifactory with the initial {@link Provenance} state.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         <strong>Unused property</strong>: the evaluated property is already known to the Artifactory, but it's
 *         not usage is not yet linked to the affected artifact version. The result would contain an updated
 *         {@link Provenance} record with new occurrences state and potentially the first and last seen versions.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         <strong>Used property</strong>: this means that the evaluated property is known, and it's usage is
 *         already linked to the affected artifact version in the Artifactory. The result would contain the
 *         current unmodified {@link Provenance} record state.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
