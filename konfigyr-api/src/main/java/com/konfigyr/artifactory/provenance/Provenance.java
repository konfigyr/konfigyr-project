/**
 * Represents the provenance metadata for a single, unique {@link com.konfigyr.artifactory.PropertyMetadata}
 * that defines a Spring Boot configuration property.
 * <p>
 * This record captures the lifecycle of a property's usage across different Spring Boot versions. The core
 * challenge addressed by this record is handling property metadata that can arrive out of chronological order.
 * For example, metadata for version 3.5.6 might be processed before version 3.1.2. The consuming system must be
 * able to correctly determine the first and last versions regardless of the ingestion sequence.
 * <p>
 * This record is designed as a data carrier for these four pieces of information:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The unique checksum of the property.</li>
 *     <li>The earliest version where the property was observed.</li>
 *     <li>The latest version where the property was observed.</li>
 *     <li>The total number of unique versions that have used this property.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param checksum The unique SHA-256 checksum of the property. This is used as the primary
 *                 key to identify a specific property across different versions. Can't be {@literal null}.
 * @param firstSeen The first version of Spring Boot where this property was mentioned, can't be {@literal null}.
 * @param lastSeen The last known version of Spring Boot where this property was mentioned, can't be {@literal null}.
 * @param occurrences The total number of unique versions that have included this property. It must be positive.
